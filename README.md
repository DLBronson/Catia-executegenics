I heard you have an FPT Ronin in your machine shop. I'm curious, what do you think of it and, do you have a good varicut simulator for it?

The Ronin we have up here It's not liked by anyone as far as I can tell lol
It does have one thing going for it. It's dislike is even across the board. There's no mixed feelings about it
