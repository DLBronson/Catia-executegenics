I heard you have an FPT Ronin in your machine shop. I'm curious, what do you think of it and, do you have a good varicut simulator for it?

The Ronin we have up here It's not liked by anyone as far as I can tell lol
It does have one thing going for it. It's dislike is even across the board. There's no mixed feelings about it


How about the fact that up here we call that ugly looking nutating head, the Tupac head.

You and I both work for a company that has a Tupac head

I'm starting to think that there might be something wrong with me because every time I see that new tating head I cringe. It's like looking at an unmade bed I just don't like those new tating heads they're weird and I just don't get it like why they're even made



The car has 150 shot of nitrous now but I have a different style plate for injecting, this new one is supposed to be a lot better

The engine is built by a company called blueprint engines and when I bought the engine it came shipped to my home in a crate, of course, and the dyno sheet show that it made 460 ft lb of torque and the same horsepower roughly about 460 horsepower on top of 150 extra horsepower of nitrous is where I'm at now
