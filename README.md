I heard you have an FPT Ronin in your machine shop. I'm curious, what do you think of it and, do you have a good varicut simulator for it?

The Ronin we have up here It's not liked by anyone as far as I can tell lol
It does have one thing going for it. It's dislike is even across the board. There's no mixed feelings about it


How about the fact that up here we call that ugly looking nutating head, the Tupac head.

You and I both work for a company that has a Tupac head
